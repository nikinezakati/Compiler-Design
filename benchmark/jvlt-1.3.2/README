jVLT is a vocabulary learning tool written in Java. You can build your
vocabulary with it and specify examples containing one or many of the
vocabulary words. jVLT also can perform quizzes, querying only those words
which you often did not know in the past or which have not been queried
for a long time. During a quiz, jVLT shows the examples of each word,
letting you better memorize its usage.
