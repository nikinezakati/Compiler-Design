# Benchmark projects

All OpenUnderstand features are evaluated with real-world Java projects.
A set of nine Java projects in different scales (small, moderate, and large size) are available at the benchmark directory of the OpenUnderstand repository. 

To test your module with one of the benchmark projects, first, unzip it and then use it in your testbed. 
Please do not add/commit any unzipped file to the benchmark directory.

The description of these projects are available on [CodART benchmark projects](https://m-zakeri.github.io/CodART/benchmarks).
