# Entity kinds

This section explains the general categories of OpenUnderstand entity kinds for different programming languages.

## Java
The total number of OpenUnderstand Java entity kinds is 169. Table 1 lists the general categories of Java entity kinds, the kind names, and the kind examples for use with Python. The _Visibility_ term should be replaced with one concrete access modifier terms, including Default, Private, Protected, Public.  

### General kind keys

* “Default” is used in kind names for entities with default visibility.
* “Public” is used in kind names for entities declared as having public
visibility.
* “Protected” is used in kind names for entities declared as having
protected visibility.
* “Private” is used in kind names for entities declared as having
private visibility.
* “Abstract" is used in kind names for classes and methods that are declared as abstract.
* “Member” is used in kind names for entities that can be class
members (for example classes and methods).
* “Final” is used in kind names for entities declared as final
(non-extendable).
* “Static” is used in kind names for entities declared as static.
* “Type” is used in kind names for classes and interfaces.
